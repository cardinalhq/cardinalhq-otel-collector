# chqdatadog receiver

This is a fork of the standard datadog receiver to make it easier to use in a multi-pod
environment as well as ensure that the incoming telemtry is converted to semantic
OTEL attributes.

This may eventually be submitted as a change request.  Documentation on this component
is limited as its primary use case is intended to be in the Cardinal collector ecosystem.
